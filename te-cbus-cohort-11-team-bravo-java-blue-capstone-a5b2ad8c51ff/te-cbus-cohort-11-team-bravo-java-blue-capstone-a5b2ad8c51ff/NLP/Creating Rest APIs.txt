Creating REST APIs
You've already learned how to create GET and POST handler methods. Creating PUT and DELETE are very similar and require adding the respective HTTP method to the RequestMapping declaration:

/**
 * Updates a product based on the ID and the request body
 *
 * @param product the updated product
 * @param id the id of the product that is getting updated
 */
@RequestMapping( path = "/products/{id}", method = RequestMethod.PUT )
public void update(@RequestBody Product product, @PathVariable int id) {
    product.setId(id);

    // Update product in underlying datastore
}

/**
 * Removes a product based on the ID
 *
 * @param id the ID of the product to remove
 */
@RequestMapping( path = "/products/{id}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE )
public void delete(@PathVariable int id) {

    // Removes the product in underlying datastore

}
