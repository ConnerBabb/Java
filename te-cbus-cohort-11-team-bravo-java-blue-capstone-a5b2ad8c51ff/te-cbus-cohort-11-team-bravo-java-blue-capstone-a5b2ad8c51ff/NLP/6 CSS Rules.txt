Along with the selector, a CSS rule consists of at least one property and value. For instance, if you wanted to change the background color of all divs to red, you could write a rule like this:

div {
    background-color: red;
}
In the example above, background-color is the property, and red is the value that is being set to that property. Note that the property and value are separated by a colon : and the CSS rule has a semi-colon ; at the end. The semi-colons are important when you have multiple property/value pairs.

If you wanted to also style those divs to be only 500px wide, the CSS rule would look like this:

div {
    background-color: red;
    width: 500px;
}
You can find all the CSS properties that can be changed on CSS Reference
