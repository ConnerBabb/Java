What is REST?
REST stands for Representational State Transfer and is a series of guidelines for defining Web Services that are flexible and usable by a wide range of services. Fundamentally, REST uses all the standard web technologies you've already learned: HTTP, URLs, and JSON. By building web services off of already widely adopted standards, REST makes it easy to tie APIs into existing applications.

REST APIs are based on the concept of "resources" and building addresses—in the form of URLs—and actions—in the form of HTTP methods—on those resources. It also uses HTTP Status Codes to alert the API users about the results of the call.
