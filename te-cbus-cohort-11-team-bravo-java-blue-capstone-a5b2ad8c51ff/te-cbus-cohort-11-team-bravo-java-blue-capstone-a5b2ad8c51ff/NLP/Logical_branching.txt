Logical branching
As a programmer, you may come across a situation where your program must decide what to do next based on the data available to it:

A healthcare portal might display different pages based on the age of the website visitor - think senior citizen vs. young adult
If a user hasn't logged in, show them the login page; otherwise allow them to proceed
If a username is already taken, tell the user to select another username
This section discusses concepts that enable code to make decisions and determine what to do next.

By the end of this chapter, you should:

Understand how to build boolean expressions using arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
Understand how to write conditional code using boolean expressions
Be able to read and understand complex code expressions
Be able to demonstrate an understanding of code blocks and variable scope
Be familiar with the components of a method signature
