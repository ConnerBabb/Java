Expressions
You now know one way to assign values to a variable: use literals and other variables. Another way to assign values to a variable is to use an expression. Expressions are statements that get evaluated and produce a single result, which can then be used in another statement.

An example that you may be familiar with could be:

200 / 10
You know that this arithmetic expression yields a single value: 20. In a program, it could be used in a similar way.

int milesPerGallon = 200 / 10;      //200 / 10 is evaluated to 20 which is then saved into the variable.
As you continue reading, expressions will take on many forms. Next, you'll see how arithmetic expressions can be used with variables in programs.

Arithmetic expressions
There is usually a need for simple calculations when your programs run. To do that, you have access to the following arithmetic operators:

Assume: A is equal to 15 and B is equal to 2.

Operator	Description	Example
+	Adds two operands	A + B = 17
-	Subtracts two operands	A - B = 13
*	Multiplies two operands	A * B = 30
/	Divides two operands	A / B = 7
%	Finds the remainder after division	A % B = 1
These operators can be combined with () to group parts of the expression together.

int a = 15;
int b = 2;
int result;

result = a + b;     //expression is evaluated to 17 and copied into result
result = a - b;     //expression is evaluated to 13 and copied into result
result = a * b;     //expression is evaluated to 30 and copied into result
result = a / b;     //expression is evaluated to 7 and copied into result
result = a % b;     //expression is evaluated to 1 and copied into result

//In the below statement, a is multiplied with b first. The output is divided
//by the current value of the result variable. This final value is assigned
//into the result value.
result = (a * b) / result;

// Translates to
//  result = (15 * 2) / result;
//      result = 30 / result;
//      result = 30 / 1;
//      result = 30;
