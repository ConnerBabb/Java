BEST PRACTICES FOR FOLLOW UP

Follow up within 24 hrs after any interview.

If you applied to a position online, make sure you reach out to the right person on the hiring team on LinkedIn or via email. Don't fall into the black hole of job applications! Check out Hunter.io or Rapportive for easy-to-use apps to find email addresses.

If you have interviewed and haven't heard back after one week, send another follow up.

If you applied to a position and reached out to someone directly but haven't heard back, send a follow up within two weeks.
