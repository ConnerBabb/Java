Mobile First
With the shift in internet consumption coming from mobile devices, mobile screens are now the primary means in which users interact with your applications. As such, the term mobile-first was coined to indicate that applications should be developed with a "mobile-first mindset."

As developers, instead of adding breakpoints into the design as the width of the screen gets smaller, you should create breakpoints in the design when the width of the screen gets larger.

One approach that helps provide a mobile-first approach is to simulate mobile devices using Chrome or Firefox's Responsive Web Design tools.

A simple strategy to follow for introducing breakpoints is to start with the small screen first, then expand until it looks bad. At this point, it's time to insert a new breakpoint.
