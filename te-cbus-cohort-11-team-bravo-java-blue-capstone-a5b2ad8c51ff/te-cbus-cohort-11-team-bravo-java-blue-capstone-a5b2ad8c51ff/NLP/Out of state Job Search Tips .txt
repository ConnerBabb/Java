Out of state Job Search Tips 
If you’re interested in expanding your job search to outside your region/state, this guide will walk you through some best practices and tips on how to do so strategically.


RESEARCH BOOTCAMPS IN THAT AREA
Do a Google search to see which Bootcamps are popular in that area (ie-- “Austin coding bootcamps”)
Once you find a popular bootcamp, go on LinkedIn and search for grads from that bootcamp who are currently working as Developers
Example: “General Assembly” AND “Developer” AND “Austin” (or select Austin as the location)
Take note of which companies these students are now working at---obviously these are companies who are open to bootcamp students 
Research and apply to these companies (use the two-pronged approach!)
Reach out to alumni from these bootcamps and ask them to connect
Ask them what other companies they interviewed at, where their classmates ended up accepting jobs, what other companies interacted with the bootcamp, etc
Go to the websites for the bootcamps and see if they have a section for ‘hiring partners’ (Tech Elevator has a page like this on our website)

OTHER TIPS
Are there any TE alumni in the area you’re looking? 
Ask your PW Director if you’re not sure! We have TE alumni throughout the country
Do a LinkedIn search for Junior Developers in the location you’re interested in
Example: “Austin” AND (“Junior Developer” OR “entry-level developer” OR “associate developer” OR “associate software engineer”)
Reach out to these people for tips/advice
Take note of what company they’re at to see if there are any open positions
Use the two-pronged approach for out of state jobs!
