Router view
The <router-view></router-view> component is a functional component that renders the matched component for the given path.

When you add Vue Router to a new or existing project, your App.vue looks like this:

<template>
  <div id="app">
    <div id="nav">
      <router-link to="/">Home</router-link>|
      <router-link to="/about">About</router-link>
    </div>
    <router-view />
  </div>
</template>
You now know that <router-link></router-link> provides navigation to different components. The next part of that is the <router-view> component below it. This component takes whatever the current component is for the given path and loads it
