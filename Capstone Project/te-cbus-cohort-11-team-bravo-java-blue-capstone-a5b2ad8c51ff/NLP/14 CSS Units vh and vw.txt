CSS Units: vh and vw
In the previous example, you defined the container as 500px in height. In this scenario, you know that the middle row is 300px because the container has a fixed height. What if you want the container to stretch the entire height of the viewport?

There are two CSS units of measure that allow you to do this:

vh: Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport
vw: Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport
You can use vh to set the height of the container. In this example, you'd define the height as 100vh to set the container's height to be 100% of the viewport. Using vh and the fr unit, you can define three rows that evenly stretch the entire height of the screen:

body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.container {
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-gap: 20px;
}
