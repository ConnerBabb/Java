RESUME TIPS


Resumes = 1 page max
More than 10-15 years exp. = 2 pages ok
Headers should stand out
Proofread grammar, spelling, punctuation
Keep your resume formatting consistent
Page margins should be a min. of 0.5 inch
Avoid pictures or distracting visuals
Avoid tables, columns and charts


On average, recruiters spend 6 seconds looking at each resume. Make every second count.


EASY ON THE EYES

Fonts: Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman 
Font Size: 10 - 12
Right justify dates and locations 
Left justify your content
Don’t center your text
Use ALL-CAPS very sparingly
Use digits when writing about numbers
White space is good


WRITING BULLET POINTS

Include 2-6 bullet points per position 
Use an action verb with every bullet
Focus on accomplishments and impact
Present positions = Present tense        Past positions = Past tense
When something is quantifiable, incorporate numbers / percentages
Use periods for all or none of the bullets



ADDITIONAL NOTES

“References available upon request” is assumed so leave it off your resume
Use a professional email address (avoid rockstar27@hotmail.com)
Have a professional voicemail and make sure your inbox isn’t full
You can have multiple versions of your resume to align to different careers or to a particular job description
Always PDF your resume and use that format when submitting for jobs
Title your resume with your name and date of last update (i.e.: John Doe_May 2017)
Once you gain career experience in the field, you can re-order your headers (the above recommendations are for entry level IT jobs)
