Applying content alignment to flex items
The ability to align and justify content is where the value of Flexbox really shines. Flexbox considers content to be on two axises for arranging items inside a container.

To arrange items in the vertical axis, you'd use the align-items property. justify-content arranges items along the horizontal axis:

#Arranging flexbox items along the vertical axis

#bottom-horizontal {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-start; /* | flex-end */
}

}

#Spacing flexbox items along the horizontal axis
To space items along the horizontal axis, you'd use space-evenly, space-between and space-around. These CSS properties provide spacing in various ways. Look at the examples below to see the subtle differences achieved by using each of these properties.

#justify-content: space-evenly
#bottom-horizontal {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
}

#justify-content: space-between
#bottom-horizontal {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
