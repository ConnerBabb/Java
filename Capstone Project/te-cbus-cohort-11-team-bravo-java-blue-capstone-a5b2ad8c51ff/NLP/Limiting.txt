LIMITing
You can also add another clause to your SQL to only return a certain number of rows. This can be useful for pulling back the top result of a query or for paging results from an SQL query.

If you want to pull back just the oldest child in the table, run this statement:

SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 1
It gives you this result:

first_name	last_name	age
Nick	Smith	11
