Conditional code
There are many different choices available to programmers who want their code to take various paths based on a true or false condition.

The most common approach developers use to allow their code to take various paths is if, if/else, or if/else if/else.

With each of the following examples, any usage of the word condition can be replaced by a boolean expression that can consist of a simple boolean variable or a more complex one evaluated from comparison and logical operators.

#Single conditions with if
The format for an if condition follows:

if (condition) {
    statement or block performed if condition is true
}
#Two paths with if/else
The format for an if/else condition follows:

if (condition) {
    statement or block performed if condition is true
} else {
    statement or block performed if condition is not true
}
Don't add conditions for else

Notice that there's no condition after the else keyword. You don't need to add a condition because else always executes if the condition in the if section is false.

#Multiple paths using if/else if/else
If you need to provide more than two paths for the code to take, you can use an if/else if code branch. With the if/else if, each time you write if, you need to supply an additional condition that indicates if the following code block should execute.

Once Java or C# runs into the first true condition, it executes the following block of code. After that block, the program resumes after the last conditional block:

if (condition) {
    statement or block you do if the first condition is true
} else if (other condition) {
    statement or block you do if the first condition is false
    and the second condition is true
} else if (other condition 2) {
    statement or block you do if the first two conditions are false
    and the third condition is true
} else {
    statement or block you do if all the above conditions are false
}
`Else` not required

The else isn't required. It's only useful if you want a default option if all the conditions before it are false.

Prioritize your conditional checks

When chaining multiple if/else if blocks, make sure to put your most exclusive option first. Programs stop at the first condition they find to be true. If there are less exclusive options first, then there is a risk that the code block you thought would run does not. Consider the classic FizzBuzz problem which has programmers return 'Fizz' if a number is divisible by 3, 'Buzz' if the number is divisible by 5, and 'FizzBuzz' if the number is divisible by 3 and 5.

int n = 15;

if (n % 5 == 0) {
  // Fizz
} else if (n % 3 == 0) {
  // Buzz
} else if (n % 3 == 0 && n % 5 == 0) {
  // FizzBuzz
}
The program will never find FizzBuzz. As soon as 15 % 5 == 0 is evaluated and true, the remaining conditions are never evaluated and the result will be Fizz.

#Choosing between two values
There's another type of conditional operator that acts a lot like an if statement but is just used to select between two different values. This operator is called a Ternary Operator. It looks like this:

    conditional ? true_value : false_value
This may look odd at first, but this if shorthand comes in handy when formatting data to print to a user.

The way the ternary works is that first the condition is checked. If the condition is true, the operator returns the value after the ?, but if it's false, it returns the value after the :. You won't use this often, but it's useful in these situations:

    int numOfBananas = ...;
    String message =
        "We have " + numOfBananas + " banana" + (numOfBananas != 1 ? "s" : "");
This puts an "s" on banana if there's more than one banana.
