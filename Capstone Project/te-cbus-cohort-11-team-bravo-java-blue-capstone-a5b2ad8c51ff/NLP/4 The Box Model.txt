You may have noticed in the above diagram how each element looks like a box.

When it comes to positioning elements, every element can be thought of as a rectangular box. Some may have rounded corners or there may be circular images, but the browser treats everything as a rectangular box. This is what's known as the box model.

Along with height and width, elements also have some default properties that affect their size such as margin, padding, and border:

Padding is the space inside an element. It's the space between the element's content and border.
Border is the edge of an element. An element may not have a visible border, but you can add one with CSS.
Margin is the space outside an element. It doesn't affect the visible size of the box, but it does affect how other content gets rendered around it.
The content, padding, border, and margin are used to calculate the amount of space that an element takes up.

Below is a diagram of the box model:
