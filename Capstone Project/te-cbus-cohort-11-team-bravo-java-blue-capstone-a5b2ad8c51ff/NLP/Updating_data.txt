UPDATEing Your Data
Data is often changed in a system - for example, changing your user profile or updating a blog post - so having a way to update data is important. For SQL databases, you can do that with an update statement:

UPDATE countries SET name = 'Amazia', region = 'New Amazland'
WHERE code = 'JOE';
You'll see the familiar WHERE clause here, which now selects which rows you want to update.

Use your WHERE clause on every UPDATE

What happens if you forget the WHERE clause? The update happens on every row in the table, changing all of your data. This, typically, is a very, very bad thing.

To make sure that you'll update the correct rows, write a SELECT statement first:

SELECT * FROM countries
WHERE code = 'JOE';
Once you've verified that it brings back the rows you want, change it to an UPDATE like above.

So the structure of an UPDATE statement would be:

UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
