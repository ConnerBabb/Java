Derived Properties
Sometimes, you want properties to represent an object's state, but you need it to be dependent on other properties. For example, a full name is derived or generated using the combination "First Last."

You can add a property that lets your clock return the current time, like "01:10:42." You don't need a fourth property with its own setter. Creating one allows the possibility that the value it returns contradicts the value stored in the hour, minute, and second properties.

A derived property lets you generate the value by relying on the other properties within the class.

Clock.java
Program.java
// Clock.java
public class Clock {
    private int hour;
    private int minute;
    private int second;

    public String getCurrentTime() {
        return this.hour + ":" + this.minute + ":" + this.second;
    }

    public void setHour(int hour) {
        this.hour = hour;
    }

    public void setMinute(int minute) {
        this.minute = minute;
    }

    public void setSecond(int second) {
        this.second = second;
    }

    public int getHour() {
        return this.hour;
    }

    public int getMinute() {
        return this.minute;
    }

    public int getSecond() {
        return this.second;
    }
}
