Overloading methods and constructors
To provide users of your class with different options when they instantiate new objects or invoke new methods, you can create an overloaded method or overloaded constructor.

As a programmer, when you overload a method or constructor, you add flexibility to your class so that users can leverage different inputs when interacting with it.

There are three rules of an overloaded method:

Overloaded methods must have the same name.
Overloaded methods must have the same return type (does not apply to constructors).
Overloaded methods must differ in the number of parameters and/or parameter types.
