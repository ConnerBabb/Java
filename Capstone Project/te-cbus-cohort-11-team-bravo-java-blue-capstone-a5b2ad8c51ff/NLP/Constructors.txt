Constructors
When you define classes, you want to make sure it can be instantiated into a useable state. That is, when the new statement creates a new object, you should be able to provide any arguments the class needs to allow usability afterwards. To do this, you use a constructor.

A constructor is a special method of a class that initializes an object of that type. All constructors have the same name as the class they're in.

Below, the Clock class has a Clock constructor. The constructor provides users the ability to set the clock to a specific time when instantiated.

Clock.java
Program.java
// Clock.java
public class Clock {
    private int hour;
    private int minute;
    private int second;

    // Constructor has same name and spelling of class.
    // Notice there isn't a return type with constructors.
    public Clock(int hour, int minute, int second) {
        this.hour = hour;
        this.minute = minute;
        this.second = second;
    }
}
