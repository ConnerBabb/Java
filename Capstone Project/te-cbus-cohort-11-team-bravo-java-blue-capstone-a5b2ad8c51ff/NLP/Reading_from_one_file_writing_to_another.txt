Reading from one file while writing to another
Sometimes you need to read from one file and write to another file. This can happen when doing any kind of manipulation of text files, like search and replace.

All files being opened should be opened in the try-with-resources block, and you can do that by separating the files with a semicolon:

try (
    Scanner dataInput = new Scanner(inputFile);
    PrintWriter dataOutput = new PrintWriter(outputFile)
) {
    while(dataInput.hasNext()) {
        String lineOfInput = dataInput.nextLine();
        dataOutput.println(lineOfInput.replace("mobile", "cellphone"));
    }
} catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {
    System.err.println("Can not open the file for writing.");
}
Never Read and Write to the Same File

It might not be obvious, but reading and writing to the same file is a bad idea. While the language might allow you to do it, doing this can cause all sorts of problems and is discouraged.

If you want to change a file directly, say, finding a word and replacing it in the same file, you should instead read from the original file, write to a new empty file and, when you're done and everything is successful, move the copy to the original's location to overwrite the original file.
