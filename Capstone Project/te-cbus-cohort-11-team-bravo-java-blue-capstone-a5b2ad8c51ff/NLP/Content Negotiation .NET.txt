Content negotiation
When the List() method went from returning IList<string> to IList<Todo>, how did ASP.NET Core MVC know to switch from sending strings to sending JSON data in the HTTP response?

Content negotiation is an HTTP mechanism that's used for serving different formats of a resource at the same URL. The client specifies which formats it can understand in the Accept header of the HTTP request. JSON is the default format for ASP.NET Core.

The switch from a list of strings to JSON is handled automatically by ASP.NET based on the return type of the controller action.

For example, here's the return type of IList<string>:

[HttpGet]
public IList<string> List()
It returns data as an array of strings:

['Wake up', 'Shower', 'Drive to work'];
Here's the return type of IList<Todo>:

[HttpGet]
public IList<Todo> List()
It returns data as an array of JSON objects:

[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "task": "Wake up",
        "dueDate": "0001-01-01T00:00:00",
        "completed": false
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "task": "Shower",
        "dueDate": "0001-01-01T00:00:00",
        "completed": false
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "task": "Drive to work",
        "dueDate": "0001-01-01T00:00:00",
        "completed": false
    }
]
The great thing about ASP.NET is that it provides these capabilities out of the box
